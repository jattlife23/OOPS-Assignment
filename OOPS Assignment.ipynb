      "source": "#### The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n\n#### 1. Encapsulation: This concept involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called an object. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps protect the integrity of the data.\n\n#### 2. Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.\n\n#### 3. Inheritance: Inheritance allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). \n\n#### 4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing methods to be defined in multiple forms. \n\n#### 5. Composition: Composition is a design principle that involves building complex objects from simpler ones. Rather than inheriting behaviors, a class can contain instances of other classes, allowing for greater flexibility and modularity in code design.\n\n##### These concepts work together to create a powerful paradigm for software development, enhancing code organization, reusability, and maintainability.",
